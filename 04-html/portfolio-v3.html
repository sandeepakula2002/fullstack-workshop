    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        I am a Computer Science graduate and a passionate fresher with a strong interest in web development
        and software engineering. I have a solid foundation in front-end and back-end technologies such as
        HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, SQL, Python, and Java. During my academic journey and internships,
        I worked on real-time projects that helped me understand how web applications are designed,
        developed, and maintained in a professional environment.
    </p>
    <p>
        I have hands-on experience in building responsive web pages, implementing CRUD operations,
        validating forms, and integrating databases using MySQL. I am also familiar with core computer
        science concepts such as OOPS, DBMS, and Computer Networks, which help me write structured,
        efficient, and maintainable code. In addition, I have basic exposure to cloud technologies,
        especially Microsoft Azure, and understand the fundamentals of deploying applications on the cloud.
    </p>
    <p>
        I am a quick learner, highly motivated, and always eager to explore new technologies.
        I enjoy solving problems, improving my coding skills, and building applications that provide
        real value. I am currently looking for an opportunity to start my professional career in the IT
        industry where I can contribute to a team, learn continuously, and grow as a software developer.

        <h4>Paying Guest Management System</h4>
        <p>
            The PG Management System is a web-based application developed to simplify and automate
            the management of paying guest accommodations. The system allows administrators to
            efficiently manage tenant details, room allocation, rent tracking, and basic record
            maintenance through a clean and user-friendly interface, reducing manual effort
            and improving accuracy.
        </p>
        <p>
            This project is developed using HTML and CSS for structure and styling, JavaScript
            for client-side interactivity, PHP for server-side logic, and MySQL for database management.
            It implements core CRUD operations, proper form validation, and secure database interactions.
            Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in full-stack web development
            and learned how different technologies work together in a real-world application.
